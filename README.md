To run: No command line arguments are needed at the moment.

Please note that I made the object file myself, which is why it has somewhere upwards of 68,000 vertices. 

TODO: lighting, camera rotation, zoom, flying spheres. It would be nice if these glow, but unlikely to happen in 24 hours.

Assignment description:

"The scene should consist of several 3D solid objects, and at least two
instances of the same object, but with each instance at a different position,
scale and orientation. The program must create at least one generic object, and
then create each instance by translation, rotation and scaling of the generic
object.

You must generate the objects yourself.  Canned GLU or GLUT objects may not be
used.  At least one of the objects must be something that is not provided in
the class examples, i.e. not a sphere or a cube.

The program should allow the scene to be viewed from different viewpoints using
the cursor keys or mouse.

The program should instruct OpenGL to remove those parts of the objects that
are obstructed by other objects in the scene.

Think ahead. You may want to build on this program for subsequent assignments.
In particular, be aware that GLUT objects do not support textures, which will
be a problem later on."
